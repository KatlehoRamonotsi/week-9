FNB App Academy final python project

FNB App Academy – Final Week

Week 9 marked the final chapter of the FNB App Academy journey. After eight incredible weeks of exploring front-end and back-end development, we wrapped things up by going deeper into Python — sharpening our skills and learning how to handle real-world coding challenges.

Here’s what I covered:

Writing Python Functions
Learned how to define and reuse blocks of code using functions — a core concept for building modular, maintainable apps.

Python Modules
Explored how to break large codebases into manageable parts using modules, and how to import built-in or custom modules into my projects.

Rectangle Area & Perimeter Calculator Project
A practical application of functions where I calculated the area and perimeter of rectangles using user input and function logic.

Exception Handling
Wrapped up the week by learning how to handle errors gracefully using try, except, and finally blocks — a must-have skill for building reliable applications.
